## What did I learn from this?

I learnt a little bit about I2C communication between components. I also learnt how to make my own kicad schematic symbol for components that I could not find the symbol for online.

> I also learnt the importance of time management skills and that it is not a good idea to try to complete a project with a deadline the day before it is due in. Especially when the concepts are completely new to me and would require more research than a concept I am already familiar with.
